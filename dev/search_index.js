It is possible to overwrite the extimation of the trailing edge and leading edge made by the code providing the relative points numbers. The mesh can be created in 2D or 3D. In 3D case by default are created periodic boundary conditions in the z direction. It is possible to create a mesh with the following options:\n\nType of element Dimension Symbol\nQuadrilateral 2D :QUAD\nHexaedral 3D :HEX\nTriangular 2D :TRI\nThetraedreal 3D :TETRA\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#AirfoilGmsh.from_url_to_csv","page":"Introduction","title":"AirfoilGmsh.from_url_to_csv","text":"from_url_to_csv(url::String)\n\nProvide an url from arifoiltools.com and it writes a formatted .csv which can be used to create the mesh.\n\nurl =\"http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/seligdatfile?airfoil=sd7003-il\"\nfilename = from_url_to_csv(url)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#AirfoilGmsh.increase_resolution_airfoil","page":"Introduction","title":"AirfoilGmsh.increase_resolution_airfoil","text":"increase_resolution_airfoil(filename::String, N::Int64; dz = 0.0, w0 = [-0.1294, -0.0036, -0.0666, -0.01, 0.206, 0.2728, 0.2292, 0.1, 0.1,0.1], maxiters = 100.0, maxtime=100.0)\n\nFrom a .csv file specified in ´filename´ it increase the points which define the airfoil surface, creating a total of ´N´ points.  ´dz´ is the half height of the trailing edge.
