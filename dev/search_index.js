From a csv file containing the airfoil points it creates a .geo file. The .geo file can be created using the function from_url_to_csv. The user can specify just the file name. ´´´julia     create_geofile(\"naca0012.csv\") ´´´ It is also possibile to provide extra arguments such as the Reynolds number and/or the first layer height for a better extimation of the boundary-cell properties. It is possible to overwrite the extimation of the trailing edge and leading edge made by the code providing the relative points numbers. The mesh can be created in 2D or 3D. In 3D case by default are created periodic boundary conditions in the z direction. It is possible to create a mesh with the following options: Type of element | Dimension | Symbol | Quadrilateral | 2D | :QUAD| Hexaedral | 3D | :HEX| Triangular | 2D | :TRI| Thetraedreal | 3D | :TETRA|\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#AirfoilGmsh.from_url_to_csv","page":"Introduction","title":"AirfoilGmsh.from_url_to_csv","text":"from_url_to_csv(url::String)\n\nProvide an url from arifoiltools.com and it writes a formatted CSV.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
